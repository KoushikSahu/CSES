## CSES

Solution to the CSES problemset implemented in rust

### Steps to run a program

```bash
cargo build --bin <problem-name> # compiles the file
cargo run --bin <problem-name> # runs the file
```

### Project directory structure

`src/bin`: This is where all of the solution files are present. Each problem has a single file which implements the solution in rust.
`Cargo.toml`: Has metadata about the project and the rust compiler to use.
